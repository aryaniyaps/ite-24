          Six years after it snapped its ties with the National Democratic
          Alliance (NDA), the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) is all set for its return
          to the BJP-led bloc ahead of the Lok Sabha elections 2024, party
          sources said. TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu met Union Home Minister
          Amit Shah and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda on Thursday
          exacerbating the noise around the potential alliance before the
          announcement of dates of general elections. Naidu and Shah are likely
          to meet again on Friday as well, and an official announcement related
          to the alliance is anticipated in the next one or two days, reported
          NDTV. Jana Sena Party (JSP) President and actor Pawan Kalyan is also
          likely to be present in the meeting.
